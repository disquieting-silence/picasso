Trying to start new game now and generalising it all a bit. The idea of the 
new game will be that you have four arrows and you have to manoeuvre your
unit around the maze before the time runs out.

The idea is to make it impossible to go the wrong way or backwards, but also
have a time limit so that just pressing every direction stops working after 
a while.

But first, I'm separating out the common elements.
